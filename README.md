**DSA＋DAG (Distribution Structure Analysis + Directed Acyclic Graph)**  
is a causal inference AI framework for healthcare and pharmaceutical real-world data (RWD),  
designed to identify structural heterogeneity and explicitly model causal mechanisms beyond correlation.


## Overview
DSA＋DAG is an integrated causal inference framework combining
Distribution Structure Analysis (DSA) and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)
to interpret real-world data beyond correlation.

## Why DSA＋DAG
- Average-based analysis fails to explain heterogeneity
- Correlation does not imply causation
- RWD requires structural interpretation, not aggregation

## Core Concept
1. Identify structural heterogeneity in distributions (DSA)
2. Explicitly model causal assumptions (DAG)
3. Generate interpretable, reproducible causal hypotheses

## Typical Use Cases
- RWD to RWE transformation
- Observational study hypothesis generation
- Pre-RCT causal structure design
- Healthcare and pharmaceutical analytics

## Outputs
- Distribution structure visualization
- Causal DAG models
- Interpretable summaries
- Reproducible analysis logs
- Manuscript-ready drafts

## Status
- Patent pending
- Manuscript under peer review (Medical Research Methodology)
- This repository serves as a conceptual and citation hub; no source code is publicly released.
